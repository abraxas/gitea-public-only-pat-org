# gitea-public-only-pat-org

**Gitea** `1.27.3` - Gitea

`public-only` on a PAT is supposed to be the promise that the token cannot touch private resources. [`POST /user/repos`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/routers/api/v1/api.go) has [`rejectPublicOnly`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/routers/api/v1/api.go). [`POST /orgs`](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/v1.27.3/routers/api/v1/api.go) has `tokenRequiresScopes` and `reqToken`. It does not have `rejectPublicOnly`. [`DEFAULT_ALLOW_CREATE_ORGANIZATION`](https://docs.gitea.com/administration/config-cheat-sheet) defaults true.

**A public-only PAT with `write:organization` creates a private organization. The same token cannot create a private user repository.**

## What an attacker can do

Use a stolen or over-issued **public-only** PAT that also has `write:organization`. Create a **private organization**. That org is a hiding place the token was not supposed to be able to make. The same token still cannot create a private user repository, and this bug does not open someone else's existing private git.

Integrity, not a private-git dump. Useful when the victim issued "public-only" on purpose: CI, a bot, a contractor token they thought could not grow a private org.

Org-repo create only checks org visibility. Deprecated `POST /org/{org}/repos` skips public-only entirely. I labbed org create. That is enough.

## How I found it

Same leftover pass as the [hostmatcher 0.0.0.0/8](https://github.com/abraxas/gitea-hostmatcher-0000-ssrf) lab: v1.27.3 after the GHSA wave, then the handlers that still skip a gate a sibling already has. Visibility and token-scope bugs were a theme of that wave. I grepped `rejectPublicOnly` in `api.go`. User-repo create has it. Org create does not.

I minted a PAT with scopes `public-only,write:organization,write:repository,write:user`. Private org create returned **201**. Same token, private user-repo create, **403** `this endpoint is not available for public-only tokens`. That 403 is the control. If both had 201, the middleware would be gone entirely. If both had 403, there would be nothing to file.

Wrong turns already recorded: treating org HTTP 201 as enough (confirm `visibility=private` on GET); private user-repo create succeeding (then `rejectPublicOnly` is gone - lab requires 403); reading existing private git contents; a reverse shell. Theatre.

## Lab

```bash
cd lab
./run.sh
```

Target **only** `http://127.0.0.1:18132`. Compose sets `DEFAULT_ALLOW_CREATE_ORGANIZATION=true`.

```text
token-scopes=public-only,write:organization,write:repository,write:user
org-create status=201
org-visibility='private'
user-repo-create status=403 this endpoint is not available for public-only tokens
SUCCESS GITEA-PUBLIC-ONLY-PAT
```

## The fix

Put `rejectPublicOnly()` on `POST /orgs`, and treat org-repo create as public-only-sensitive too. Public-only org create must 403 the same way private user-repo create already does.
